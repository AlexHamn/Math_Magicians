        You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind.
        Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche,
        it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don&apos;t know exactly when we turned on each
        other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out.
        Now we took an oath, that I&apos;m breaking now. We said we&apos;d say it was
        the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn&apos;t. Nature is lethal
        but it doesn&apos;t hold a candle to man.

        Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show&apos;s called a pilot.
        Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that
        one show they decide if they&apos;re going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked
        and become television programs. Some don&apos;t, become nothing. She starred in one of
        the ones that became nothing.
